# summary notes

- There are two very important keys in Emacs. The first is the “meta” key. For me, this is the “Alt” key (but it could also be the Windows key, for example). You will frequently see the meta key abbreviated as just “M”, e.g. M-x means the “meta key x key” combination.

- The second important key is the “Ctrl” key. Like the meta key, you will see combinations with the key abbreviated as just “C”, e.g. C-f means the “ctrl key f key” combination.

- You may also sometimes see key combos like C-c | vs. C-c C-|. THESE ARE DIFFERENT KEY COMBOS. The first means “control key c key, release, then | key”. The second means “control key c, release, then control key | key”.

 Note: Key abbreviations:
 _________

    M – Alt (used to be called Meta on ancient keyboards, that's why)
    C – Control
    S – Shift
    C-x f – means holding both Control and x, release both, and press f

- To open a file and load it into a buffer, use C-x C-f

- If you make changes to the buffer and you want to save it back to the file on disk, use C-x C-s:

- If you want to save the buffer under a new file name (basically, “Save As” functionality), use C-x C-w, which will prompt you to specify the file name:

- Use M-q to wrap the paragraph of text that the point is currently in

- To move the point up or down a whole paragraph (instead of a single line), use C-up or C-down.

- To move the point past a whole word (instead of a single character), use C-left or C-right.

- To move to the beginning of a line, use the home key; to move to the end of a line, use the end key.

- To move up or down a page, you can use the page up and page down keys. To move to the beginning of the buffer, use M-.

- Start a new document (C-x b), call it 2.org, and copy and paste the following in it:
